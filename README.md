# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

# Kickstarting with Excel

## 1. Overview of Project 

### Purpose 

#### Backstory
  Client Louise has held a campaign for her play *Fever*. The fundraising goal was $2,885.00 USD. The campaign started in June and ended in July. It ran for less than a month. Funds raised during the campaign were $2,485.00, $400 short of the fundraising goal. 

#### Purpose of the Project
  The purpose of this project is to analyze how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Specifically, this project analysis whether campaigns in the category *Theatre* and subcategory *Plays* were successful, and if the outcomes are dependent on the launch date of the campaign or the fundraising goal of the campaign.

## 2. Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the category *Theatre*, the outcomes of campaigns have been analysed using data from 2009 to 2017. Campaigns were analyzed based on whether their fundraising goals were met (successful), not met (failed), or canceled (canceled). 

In the category Theatre, the largest number of campaigns were launched in May, June, and July (respectively). The graph ***Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date*** visualizes the rise in successful campaigns in the months May, June, and July.

The graph visualizes an increase in the number of campaigns launched between May to July. The campaigns launched between May and July also show an increase in a successful outcome of campaigns run. Therefore, campaigns which are launched in May, June, or July tend to have a *successful* outcome. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Using the data provided from 2009 to 2017 for the subcategory *Plays* within the parent category *Theatre*, a graph has been created to depict the success, failure and cancelation rate based on the fundraising goals of the campaigns.

The graph ***Outcomes Based on Goal***, showcases the fact that campaigns with larger fundraising goals, tend to have a higher failure rate and campaigns with lower fundraising goals, tend to have a higher success rate.

The graph depicts, that campaigns launched between 2009 and 2017, have been the most successful when the fundraising goal was lower than $15,000, and when the goals were between $35,000 to $45,000. 

Campaigns had the highest failure rates when the fundraising goals were between $15,000 to $35,000, and when they were higher than $45,000. 

No campaigns for the subcategory *Plays* have been canceled within this time frame. 

To further visualize this information, in the table of information, fields in which the success rate was **over** 50% are blue, fields in which the failure rate was **below** 50%, are in orange.
